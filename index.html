          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Poverty, Age, and Income</h2>
          <br>
          <p>As we can observe from the data that was pulled from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
            System in 2014, there are clear signs of a positive correlation between poverty and various health risks. We can see
            that with each state, as the poverty as a percentage of the population increased, so did the percentage of people who lack
            healthcare, the percentage of the population that smokes, and the obesity rate.
          </p>

          <p>With age as the dependent variable, the various health risks present correlations, although not as clear as with poverty.
            As age increases, we can see a slight positive correlation with obesity, but a large chunk of the data seems to be centered
            with a high number of obesity rates centering around the 26-36% range of the population. The percentage of the population
            that smokes sees a more positive correlation with age, but generally there are less Americans that smoke than are those who are
            obese, with the majority range lying between 14-26% of the population. Finally, with a lack of healthcare, there is a clear negative
            correlation with age, as the older Americans are, the less likely they are to lack healthcare. The percentage of the population
            that lacks healthcare in all states fluctuates primarily in the 7-18% range, with the higher median age yielding 
            lower numbers in said range.
          </p>

          <p>The final dependent variable we can observe is median household income. It's clear that as a state becomes richer, the
            health risks presented become less prominent. The most obese state, Mississipi, capped at a median household income 
            of around $40,000 and obesity rates of 35.5%, while the second least obese, Washington, D.C., saw a median household income
            of around $72,000 and obesity rates of 21.7%. There's a clear trend in a similar fashion between household income and the percentage
            of population that smokes, as well, albeit the percentage of smokers in the United States is significantly lower than the percentage of
            obese. Finally, there is also a clear negative correlation between median household income and lack of healthcare. The majority of
            states lie between the 7-19% range of populations that lack healthcare, with the lowest median incomes yielding less healthcare coverage.
          </p>

          <p>In conclusion, there is a clear positive correlation between poverty and health risks, and aversely, negative correlations between 
            higher median household income and the aforementioned risks. With age, the picture is not so clear, but there is a slight trend towards
            more healthcare coverage and more smokers as age increases.
